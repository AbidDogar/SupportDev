This is Abid Dogar and this package includes many different Jave tutorials for my students to practice.
Even though I try my best to test my codes but still there can be some bugs or unhandled exceptions. So please use them on your discretion as I will not be responsible for any issues whats so ever. Thank you and good luck!
